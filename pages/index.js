        <h2 id="ethics">Ethical Problems</h2>
        <p>
          We first examine the ethics of data centers under a utilitarian
          framework, that is we look at the use of data centers in the context
          of their consequences. A couple of notes on this framework: We use
          well-being as the calculus for weighting the consequences of data
          centers, and more specifically the well-being and society rather than
          that of specific individuals. Further, as we consider the ethics of
          the actions of specific companies building and utilizing these data
          centers, we look to foreseeable consequences rather than the actual
          consequences. (In the cases outlined below there does not seem to be
          much distinction between the two.) Finally, we are concerned with act
          utilitarianism rather than rule utilitarianism. In other words, we
          look to the specific consequences of the action’s firms take
          surrounding data centers, rather than the general consequences of such
          actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Undeniably, data centers are one of the main drivers of the modern
          economy. Large data banks are crucial for any business operating in
          the cloud or with cloud services. These businesses provide valuable
          services to people globally. The net impact of data centers in and of
          themselves is almost certainly positive in terms of their consequences
          to human well-being. Therefore, we focus on analyzing the specific
          practices companies, especially large companies that provide cloud
          services to billions such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon, under the
          utilitarian framework outlined above.

        <h3>Signaling</h3>
        <p>
          To begin, these data centers require a massive amount of energy
          usage.  One{" "}
          <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/united-states-data-center-energy">
            report
          </a>{" "}
          found that data centers accounted for 1.8% of total U.S. electricity
          consumption in 2014.  Unfortunately, these data centers are often
          powered by{" "}
          <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy/greenpeace-accuses-aws-fueling-virginia-data-center-growth-dirty-energy">
            nonrenewable energy sources
          </a>
          . In the face of complaints from organizations such as Greenpeace,
          companies like{" "}
          <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/renewable/">
            Google
          </a>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/there-are-no-clean-clouds/420744/">
            Facebook
          </a>{" "}
          have pledged to move to powering their data centers entirely with
          renewable energy sources. Further, these companies can often act as
          the impetus for meaningful policy around renewable energy.  For
          example, Google facilitating the creation of a new renewable energy
          program at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/there-are-no-clean-clouds/420744/">
            Duke
          </a>
          , and Facebook’s push for renewable energy in their data centers lead
          to a change from a nuclear power plant initiative to wind energy in
          Iowa. However the overall efficacy of this signaling in creating
          sustainability is{" "}
          <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/11/4172/pdf">
            questionable
          </a>
          . Moreover, the study from the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing
          Institute found that this signaling can even be counterproductive when
          corporations are found to be dishonest in their proposed support of
          sustainability. That has been the case in the context of datacenters.
          Companies often focus on promoting the clean energy sources used by
          their data centers while covering up and ignoring other environmental
          harms resulting from their use. Google for example, consumes enormous
          amounts of water in order to cool their{" "}
          <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/business/20200411/google-data-centers-secret-cost-billions-of-gallons-of-water">
            data centers
          </a>
          . Another revealing case comes from a now infamous{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/technology/data-centers-in-rural-washington-state-gobble-power.html">
            incident
          </a>{" "}
          in 2012 when Microsoft threatened to burn inordinate amounts of excess
          power in its data center to avoid paying a fine for overestimating
          consumption from the local power utility organization. These instances
          of major data center companies ignoring environmental considerations
          often undermines the power any signaling effect may have in moving
          towards sustainable initiatives.
        </p>
        <h3>Wasteful Consumption</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond the muddled impact of the signaling effect, the more direct
          harm from these data centers originates from their inefficient use of
          energy.  Regardless of the source of energy, data centers often
          continue to operate at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html">
            full capacity
          </a>
          , even when it’s not needed to do so. Data centers contributed about
          <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/18/internet-cloud-server-data-center-energy-consumption-renewable-coal/">
            0.3% of global carbon emissions in 2018
          </a>{" "}
          , yet only about 10% of the energy used by them was actually needed
          for their operations.  Given the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iea-emissions/global-carbon-emissions-hit-record-high-in-2018-iea-idUSKCN1R7005">
            33.1 billion tons
          </a>{" "}
          of carbon emissions in 2018, this translates to nearly 100 million
          tons of unneeded carbon emissions. Beyond the climate cost, the
          inefficiencies with how companies operate their data centers leads to
          a severe problem with{" "}
          <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3330650/poor-data-center-configuration-leads-to-severe-waste-problem.html">
            e-waste
          </a>
          . E-waste is rarely recycled and instead left in dumping grounds,
          largely in South and East Asia, causing severe harms to the local
          populace.  One example comes from the Chinese city of{" "}
          <a href="https://www.prb.org/e-waste/">Guiyu</a> where studies have
          found 80% of children experience respiratory ailments due to the waste
          there. Further, as we explain more extensively below, there are many
          ways to mitigate the inefficiencies in this approach, but companies
          continue to ignore them.
        </p>
        <h3>Quantifying the Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Going back to our framework at the top, we can weigh the consequences
          of how companies operate these data centers.  On one hand, the choice
          to move towards renewable sources of power for the data centers has
          led to some positive impact in terms of spurring more renewable energy
          implementations.  On the other, the extent of this effect is mitigated
          by the hypocritical actions these companies take with their data
          centers in regards to other environmental concerns. The more direct
          negative consequences, to the environment can be hard quantify.  One
          study from{" "}
          <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-01-13-measuring-%E2%80%98true-social-cost%E2%80%99-carbon-dioxide-emissions">
            Oxford
          </a>{" "}
          found that every extra metric ton of carbon emissions incurs a social
          cost of $42 due to harms to the environment. Using the excess carbon
          emissions we found above, this would mean data centers result in a
          four billion-dollar cost from energy usage not needed from their
          operations. These costs, alongside the harms to locals from waste and
          resource usage, are direct and foreseeable consequences of how data
          centers operate. From this we conclude that the inefficiencies with
          which companies run their data centers is immoral and thus we focus on
          the solutions and policy considerations of that below.
        </p>
        <div className="parallax1" />
        <h2 id="solutions">Potential Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          After seeing the environmental and ethical consequences of the status
          quo of cloud computing, it is clear that change is necessary. This
          change can come from either the companies who own and operate data
          centers or the government. From the data center side of the solution,
          the overall goal is reduce wasteful resource consumption. Two
          different strategies exist in order to accomplish this goal:
          algorithmic resource assignment and technological advancement.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, data centers waste megawatts of power each year.
          Globally, data centers consume “about 30 billion watts of electricity,
          roughly equivalent to the output of 30 nuclear power plants,” with the
          United States consuming between a quarter and a third of this{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html">
            amount
          </a>
          . However, with such high consumption, 90% or more of the power
          consumed is only utilized for keeping the server computers powered,
          meaning data centers in the United States alone are wasting as much as
          9 billion watts every year. The first solution to this problem is a
          better use of resources. Most data centers only run at 9-12%
          utilization, but the National Energy Research Scientific Computing
          Center at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California was
          able to reach 96.4%{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html">
            utilization
          </a>
          . While this was achieved by scheduling large computing jobs ahead of
          time, a strategy most large tech companies would be wary to rely on,
          significant research has been poured into the field of resource
          assignment as of late. This research can be applied to significantly
          shrink the size and number of data centers while still providing the
          same quality of service.

          The first theory of resource allocation on which many others are based

          computing service the resources for which their demand is highest,
          such as bandwidth, memory, and computer cores, and every other
          resource in proportion. While this theory improves on prior theories
          which attempted to package all of these resources into one, it still
          leaves many available resources underused. To improve upon DRF, Suhan
          Jiang and Jie Wu introduced 2-Dominant Resource Fairness{" "}

          </a>
          , an algorithm which expands the consideration of DRF to the two
          resources for which a user has the highest demand. Additionally, this
          algorithm can be expanded to consider a number <i>k</i> resources to
          further improve efficiency. Another available algorithm is Dominant
          Resource with Bottlenecked Fairness{" "}
          <a href="https://doi-org.libproxy.unl.edu/10.1109/CC.2018.8331991">

          </a>
          , an algorithm which expands upon DRF to organize users demands into
          different queues and divide resources evenly among these queues. These
          algorithms, 2DRF and DBRF, and many more like them could be used to
          reduce the number of servers required for a data center to operate
          efficiently, which would give companies which operate data centers the
          ability to eventually shrink the size of their data centers.

        <hr />

          The second avenue for data centers to reduce their resource
          consumption is through technological advancements, both in their
          cooling and backup power supplies. In an investigation of data centers
          in the southwest region, an area that is historically drought-ridden
          where careful water management is key, data centers often bully local
          water utilities with requests of 1.46 billion gallons of water a year.
          However, this water is used to cool servers in a particularly wasteful
          method of cooling: evaporative cooling. Rather trying to reduce or
          eliminate water consumption, such as with a hybrid air-cooled chiller

        <div className="parallax2" />
        <h2 id="policy">Policy Proposals</h2>
        <p>
          There are three primary areas in which public policy needs to
          progress:
        </p>
        <h3>Real Estate Investment Trusts and Data Centers</h3>
        <p>
          The problem of real estate trusts doesn't really lie with the data
          centers themselves, it rather is a problem with America's tax code. By
          reorganizing themselves as real estate investment trusts (REIT), data
          center companies are able to get out of taxes, with one company
          getting out of more than{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/technology/north-jersey-data-center-industry-blurs-utility-real-estate-boundaries.html">
            100 million
          </a>{" "}
          in taxes annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          A company in a capitalist society has an obligation to make as much
          money in profits as possible, so the data centers can't be faulted for
          wanting to reorganize. However, the government has an obligation to
          hold the corporations to their full tax burden. To this end, there is
          one primary course that the government ought to take: disallowing data
          centers from being classified as real estate investment trusts.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>
          <em>
            ...THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO HOLD THE CORPORATIONS TO
            THEIR FULL TAX BURDEN
          </em>
        </h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The government has this obligation because companies are given
          specific tax rates by democratically elected representatives, and, if
          through adminsitrative loopholes, companies manage to skirt their
          taxes, the administrative branch of the govenment has a duty to close
          that loophole.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimum Efficiency Standards</h3>
        <p>
          Some companies ran their server farms with as low as{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?auth=login-email&login=email">
            10% utilization of their total uptime
          </a>{" "}
          during 2008 and the numbers haven't improved much in recent years,
          despite an abundance of optimization algorithms designed to help
          companies run their servers with much higher utilization.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the looming threat of climate change, this wasted energy usage is
          an outrage. Companies not only have a categorical imperative to
          protect the Earth as inhabitants of it, but additionally there are
          utilitarian reasons why companies should waste less energy (lower
          energy bills, prolonging the lifespans of their consumers, protecting
          their investment in real estate, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          With these ethical reasons why the companies should not behave in the
          way they are, a casual observer is left with no other assumption that
          the companies are behaving unethically by managing their servers in
          the current fashion. Because of this, governments at some level must
          intervene to create minimum efficiency standards for these companies.
          The standards need not be too drastic even. Mandating a standard as
          low as 50% utilization would allow companies to maintain high levels
          of service uptime, and would lower the total wasted energy by a factor
          of more than 500% in some cases.
        </p>

        </h3>
        <hr />
        <h3>More Thorough Regulations</h3>
        <p>
          This goes hand in hand with the previous point, but many companies can
          and would{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/technology/data-centers-in-rural-washington-state-gobble-power.html">
            absorb the cost of a fine
          </a>{" "}
          rather than comply with legal restrictions because the penalties for
          violating energy usage laws are not thorough enough to ensure
          compliance. In one example, Microsoft incurred a $210,000 penalty for
          drastically overestimating its energy usage. It could, rather than pay
          the penalty, increase its usage wastefully by $70,000 to avoid the
          penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though that specific situation may not have been fixed by larger
          penalties (in fact, it would have exacerbated the problem), more
          thorough regulations including minimum efficiency standards would have
          prevented the problem. To close loopholes, local, state, and federal
          governments would have to cooperate on a large scale, but such is the
          necessity of an emergency like climate change. An example plan might
          include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Local utility boards keeping financial penalties at reasonable
            levels, in order to prevent situations such as what happened with
            Microsoft in Quincy, WA. This step can be taken unilaterally and
            first while waiting on a response from state and federal
            authorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many state authorities already regulate minimum efficiency standards
            for motor vehicles, so they can institute minimum utilization
            standards for companies as well. As mentioned previously, these
            standards do not have to be much to improve over the current state
            of the industry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Federal authorities need to do more to ensure that the companies
            that run these data centers cannot escape the liability that they do
            have with reorganization. As mentioned previously, companies can
            escape tax liability through changing their classification under tax
            law. By making more stringent regulations as to what types of
            business can be considered REITs, the government can use the tax
            revenues to actually improve the environment, in whatever way the
